The earliest reported figure that we have been able to find is from March 3rd 2020, at which point approximately 5,000 cumulative tests were reported.

BEL,Belgium - units unclear,2020-06-20,https://epistat.sciensano.be/Data/COVID19BE_tests.csv,Sciensano (Belgian institute for health),,112,881047,76.02,9066,0.782,9132,0.788,Sciensano (Belgian institute for health),https://epistat.wiv-isp.be/covid/,The data is described both as the number of tests performed and as the number of tested patients.,"Sciensano provides a daily time series of the number of tests conducted per day, which is updated retrospectively as new data becomes available each day.

According to the [dataset codebook](https://epistat.sciensano.be/COVID19BE_codebook.pdf), dates for new testing figures correspond to the date of laboratory diagnosis (or when not available, date of sampling). 

It appears that the reported testing figures represent the number of people tested, but this is not entirely clear. The official website describes the testing dataset as the ""Dataset of total number of tests performed by date"", yet the [dataset codebook](https://epistat.sciensano.be/COVID19BE_codebook.pdf) defines the ""tests"" variable as the ""number of tested patients"".

It is also unclear whether the testing figures include antigen tests in addition to PCR tests. In a communication on April 3rd 2020, Sciensano indicates that antigen tests made by Coris Bioconcept may now be used for COVID-19 detection. The communication states that positive antigen test results do not have to be confirmed by a PCR test, but that negative or doubtful cases must be confirmed by a PCR test.

Official figures reported in Sciensano's daily epidemiological bulletins do not help to clarify these ambiguities. For example, as of May 10th 2020, the [official time series dataset](https://epistat.sciensano.be/covid/covid19_historicaldata.html) reported a cumulative total of 465,201 tests performed between March 1st and May 9th. However, the epidemiological bulletin for [May 10th 2020](https://covid-19.sciensano.be/sites/default/files/Covid19/COVID-19_Daily%20report_20200510%20-%20FR.pdf) states that 325,796 cumulative tests had been performed by laboratories between the beginning of March and May 9th, while an additional 240,305 tests had been performed through the national testing platform (566,101 total tests).

The bulletin indicates that these figures include both PCR and antigen tests, suggesting that the large discrepancy between the 465,201 figure and the 566,101 figure may be solely due to the fact that the official time series data only includes PCR tests, whereas the official bulletin figures include both PCR and antigen tests. However, it is also possible that the discrepancy is due solely to the fact that the official time series data is reported in terms of ""people tested"", whereas the bulletin figures represent ""tests performed"". We have been unable to find official documentation from Sciensano that resolves these ambiguities."

The units for the testing numbers are unclear. They are variously referred to as tests (“pruebas”), samples (“muestras”), or people who have undergone tests (”personas, que fueron sometidas a pruebas”).

In 10 briefs the number of negative tests was not reported, preventing us from calculating a total for that date.

The figure for 29th May is the number of RT-PCR  (molecular biology) tests carried out in public laboratories.

More recently, the Ministry of Health has begun reporting figures for the number of PCR and 'rapid tests' on a dashboard on its [Panel of beds and inputs](https://covid-insumos.saude.gov.br/paineis/insumos/painel.php) webpage. However we do not include these figures because they appear to relate to the number of tests distributed, rather than the number of tests performed. This is not made clear from the dashboard itself.

- ""The actual number of infections in Finland is probably higher than reported, as not all mild symptoms have been tested so far and no information is available on the number of asymptomatic infections.""
- ""Coronavirus testing is performed in both the public and private sectors in several laboratories.""

The data description notes that tests are being rationed and allocated according to the following strategy: ""Samples are taken primarily from patients with severe symptoms of respiratory infection and from health and social care staff to ensure staff health and labor adequacy....Attention has also been paid to vulnerable groups of patients with some underlying disease and to those over 70 years of age.""

This data series extends to the 30th January, when test figures were very low (73 tests per day). It is likely this is was the first day, or close to the first day of testing."

For the week between 18 May and 24 May, [the report](https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/content/download/256362/2623085) states that 216,891 people were tested. This data does not allow us to publish any cumulative total, since no data is available on how many people had been tested prior to 18 May. However, we integrate this data into our ""daily tests"" time series by dividing 216,891 by 7 days, therefore estimating the daily number of people tested to be 30,984 on average for that week.

The [4 June situation report](https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/content/download/257630/2628879) reports 236,098 people were tested from 24 to 30 May. As the two periods overlap for 24 May, we use the more recent average testing figure for this date."

The figures in the time series relate to tests performed since 24 February. Since the 24 March update, in addition to the previously reported hospital tests, laboratory tests are also reported. Only the total number of laboratory tests performed between 24 February and 24 March is presented, without a time series. Our figure for 24 March adds the cumulative number of laboratory tests since 24 February (6,500) to the hospital tests figure (101,046). As such 24 March represents a break in the series.

The report [dated 21 May](https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/content/download/254170/2609369) specified a new screening information system (SI-DEP) had been deployed from week 20 (11-17 May) and that epidemiological trends and test positivity rates would be available from 28 May. The report published in late May reported the number of people tested instead of the number of tests performed, we therefore created a second time series for France."

Note that the number of laboratories reporting in the data seems to vary from week to week.,"To determine how many laboratory tests regarding SARS-CoV-2 are carried out per calendar week in Germany and how many tests are positive or negative, the RKI has started a Germany-wide laboratory query. However, the number of laboratories reporting data seems to vary from week to week.

The report published on 17 June states that “from the beginning of the collection up to and including calendar week 24/2020”:
– The cumulative total of samples tested was 5,029,696;
- For calendar week 24 (which ends 14 June), 168 labs reported 320,001 samples tested;
- For calendar week 23 (which ends 7 June), 176 labs reported 340,986 samples tested;
- For calendar week 22 (which ends 31 May), 178 labs reported 405,269 samples tested;
- For calendar week 21( which ends 24 May), 179 labs reported 353,467 samples tested;
- For calendar week 20 (which ends 17 May), 183 labs reported 432,666 samples tested;
- For calendar week 19 (which ends 10 May), 182 labs reported 403,875 samples tested;
- For calendar week 18 (which ends on 3 May), 175 labs reported 326,788 samples tested;
- For calendar week 17 (which ends on 26 April), 178 labs reported 363,890 samples tested;
- For calendar week 16 (which ends on 19 April), 168 labs reported 331,902 samples tested;
- For calendar week 15 (which ends on 12 April), 164 labs reported 380,197 samples tested;
– For calendar week 14 (which ends on 5 April), 154 labs reported 408,348 samples tested;
– For calendar week 13 (which ends on 29 March), 151 labs reported 361,515 samples tested;
– For calendar week 12 (which ends on 22 March), 152 labs reported 348,619 samples tested;
– For calendar week 11 (which ends on 15 March), 114 labs reported 127,457 samples tested.
– Up to and including calendar week 10 (which ends on 8 March), 90 labs reported 124,716 samples tested.

By subtracting each weekly change from the cumulative total, we retrospectively work out the cumulative totals by the end of each week.

Since laboratories can post-check the tests of past calendar weeks in the RKI test number query, previous figures may be revised upwards slightly in subsequent reports. The source is explicit that these figures refer to tests performed and that this will not equal the number of people tested, because of multiple tests per person."

From 18th February to 25th March (as of 20/05/2020), the MOH reports the number of tests implemented each week, and the daily totals thereafter. We calculate the cumulative total from the weekly and daily figures. There are instances where the cumulative totals reported in the press releases do not sum to the cumulative total calculated from the weekly and daily figures. This includes the series released on 20/21 and 24/25 May. The source does not provide additional details about this discrepancy.

But the source does not explicitly state whether these non-PCR tests are included in the reported cumulative number of tests performed to date.

The earliest reported figure is from March 13th 2020, at which point 126 tests had been conducted. It is unclear whether March 13th was the first date on which tests were conducted."

Earlier updates listed their figures as 'tests carried out'. Given that there is no visible break in the series, we assume that the figures have always related to the number of people tested and the change in label reflects only a clarification of this.

Since 19th April 2020, we are not aware of this source reporting positive, negative, and pending test figures separately, as was the case before. 

The situation updates for 27/28 May and 2 June onwards do not include the infographic detailing the total number of people tested. In these instances, we rely on the MOH daily press conference livestreams uploaded to the official facebook page. The sum of positive and negative tests reported in the livestream match the total people tested figures reported in the situation updates.

It details the jump in people tested from 14th to 15th May was due to data consolidation efforts and an improved data collection system.

Prior to 19th May, we relied on MOH web archives to reconstruct the time series. The MOH provided daily updates to the total number of cases tested. It is not clear the exact date these cumulative figures date back to. The earliest release we have been able to find begins from the 14th February. This MOH web archive provides a breakdown of the number of positive, negative, and still pending tests. We report total tests as the sum of positive and negative tests, excluding pending tests. The title of the table indicates that these figures relate to cases. As far as we are aware, cases are equivalent to individuals tested.

In a previous version of this page, we reported total tests as the sum of positive, negative, and pending tests. However, since April 7th 2020, the source has not reported the number of pending tests each day. For this reason, we have updated the time series so that total tests is equal to the sum of positive and negative tests (excluding pending tests) for all days on which we report data."

The positive, negative, and total numbers are cumulative, while the pending numbers are current as of that day.

We use here the reported total, which very likely includes pending tests. Before 16 Jun when negative numbers were reported, we used the total of positive and negative numbers rather than the reported total, since it generally included pending values and occasionally contained discrepant numbers that did not match any combination of the positive, negative, or pending numbers.

There appear to be reporting lags, such that the number of labs reporting for days in the current week tend to be lower than for the previous week. As a result, the reported figures are updated retrospectively as additional labs report their results. The figures we display are based on the latest available epidemiological report.

The epidemiological reports state that 'all laboratories in the Netherlands that perform diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 have been asked from 9 March to report these data daily.'

Note that the source states that ""Data for the last few days is incomplete and will be updated in upcoming daily reports"", that the ""Number of tested and proportion of positive findings among the tested is affected by changes in test criteria"". It also notes that ""Laboratory data is now retrieved from the new national laboratory database, which gives us [a] more complete data set with regard to sampling date"". Earlier reports noted that ""The figure contains only numbers from laboratories that have reports that include the sampling date"" [all via Google Translate]. As such, this seems to imply an increase in coverage across laboratories over time.

In addition to the aggregate number of people tested, the source provides a regional breakdown, in which it is noted that tests in 'private labs that analyze tests across the country' are excluded. The sum of this breakdown is lower than the aggregate figure provided. We take this as an indication that the main aggregate figure we report includes all private testing.

Daily reports with figures on testing are only available dating back to 16th March. We therefore do not know the first date of testing, only that as of 16th March, 18062 people had been tested.

PHL,Philippines - people tested,2020-06-20,http://www.doh.gov.ph/covid19tracker,Department of Health (DOH) Philippines,,79,547373,4.995,13267,0.121,11202,0.102,Department of Health,http://www.doh.gov.ph/covid19tracker,The number of people tested.,"The Department of Health (DOH) provides a daily snapshot of testing capacity detailing the total number of individuals tested and the total number of tests conducted. As of 15th June, the DOH provides a historical series dating back to 3rd April. These figures are subject to change as the DOH continues with its validation.

In earlier versions of the DOH portal, the total number of individuals tested was reported as the sum of positive, negative, equivocal, and invalid individuals. No definitions of equivocal and invalid individual tests were given, hence our figures only reported the sum of individuals who have tested positive or negative. From 22nd May, the DOH stopped reporting figures on equivocal and invalid individuals; the DOH provided the cumulative samples and unique individuals tested, where cumulative unique individuals = cumulative positive + cumulative negative individuals. 

The source provides a breakdown of both i) the number of individuals tested and ii) the total tests conducted, by laboratory. We are not aware of any aggregation issues. 

The DOH used to report the number of cases tested in a previous dashboard, but stopped on 4th April. This previous breakdown of the test results and COVID-19 dashboard have both been removed. We became aware of this new tracker on the 13th April with data 'as of April 11 2020, 12am'. No previous snapshots of the dashboard are available using web archive, therefore the series starts from the 11th April - the earliest date from which we have access to the data.

The testing figures may include both serological tests and PCR tests conducted. [Official testing guidelines](https://www.doh.gov.ph/sites/default/files/health-update/dm2020-0180.pdf) published on April 16th 2020 clearly state that symptomatic patients with a relevant history of travel/exposure should undergo PCR testing regardless of initial antibody test results (see Annex B), but PCR testing is not required for asymptomatic patients with a relevant history of travel/exposure despite a positive antibody test result (see Annex C). That said, the testing guidelines also state that the ""[r]apid antibody-based test is an adjunct test and shall not be used as a standalone test to definitively diagnose or rule out COVID-19"".

In the [official dashboard](http://www.doh.gov.ph/covid19tracker) where testing figures are reported, the accompanying text seems to suggest that the reported figures only include PCR tests. But this text leaves plenty of room for interpretation. For example, ""individuals tested"" is defined as ""...the total number of individuals who underwent COVID-19 testing, regardless of result, ..."", which suggests that non-PCR tests may be included in the reported figures. At the same time, the dashboard reports the number of ""remaining available tests"", which is defined as ""...how many tests the laboratories can still do based on their PCR kits on hand"", which suggests that the reported testing figures relate to PCR tests only."

The first estimate in our time series comes from a Ministry of Health press release, quoting Salvador Illa, Minister of Health: ""From the beginning of the crisis and until April 13, the total number of PCR carried out in Spain is 930,230."" The press release is [here](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/gabinete/notasPrensa.do?metodo=detalle&id=4864).

The second is another Ministry of Health press release published on 27 April and relating to testing conducted up to 23 April. It provides a breakdown across Autonomous Communities (regions), with a total for Spain of 1,035,522 PCR tests. The same release provides a figure of 310,038 antibody tests conducted nationwide. These are different to the PCR tests, as we discuss [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing#different-types-of-tests-for-covid-19). Our database aims to not include antibody tests. So in order to provide the data that is most comparable to the other countries in our database, we include only the PCR tests count for this observation.

One aspect of the 27 April press release that is not totally clear is whether the figures provided for each Autonomous Community relate to the 23 April. Comparing the regional breakdowns provided in the Ministry of Health release to those collected from official sources by CIVIO (as of 28 April) suggests that the figure of 203,892 provided for Madrid in the Ministry of Health update—ostensibly dating to the 23 April—may date back to 14 April.

Further data points are collected from the [Ministry of Health's press releases](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/gabinete/notasPrensa.do?metodo=verHistorico) or [its Twitter account](https://twitter.com/sanidadgob).

[CIVIO](https://datos.civio.es/dataset/pcr-coronavirus-covid19-espana-comunidades-autonomas/) is a non-profit investigative data journalism organisation who are collating information on tests performed within each Autonomous Community, as released through official channels (communication offices, web pages, press releases and social networks of the different regions). We do not report these figures because their data are not complete: For some autonomous communities, figures are available only irregular intervals. The figures they provide are broadly in-line with those of the Ministry of Health releases, although with somewhat lower figures for some Autonomous Communities. This may be due to the Ministry of Health having access to more recent estimates for these Autonomous Communities."

The number 'tested' is greater than the sum of confirmed cases and 'excluded' (i.e. negative) test results. This would suggest it does not equal the total number of people tested, or if it does, pending results without a reported outcome are also included.

Although the CDC only show the last day's figures on this dashboard, we can construct a time-series by looking at previous versions on web archive. Where possible we have tried to take the total test counts at the same time every day (those published at 00:30h). Unfortunately this time of publishing from CDC was not always completely consistent. This may lead to small discrepancies between 'total tested' and 'new from 'yesterday' figures. Wherever possible we took the total test count as of 00:30 as the prefered figure; where a day of data was missing we used the 'new from yesterday' figure to calculate the total for the previous day. If there are small discrepancies with other sources, this timing issue is likely to be the cause. In any case it is likely to be minor.

After the 14th April, press releases by the Office of the Director General publishes the daily number of samples tested. We sum the cumulative total number of samples tested for the previous day with the daily number of samples tested today. For example, the total number of samples tested on the 15th April is equal to the cumulative total up until the 14th April plus the number of samples tested on the 15th April. 

For the 18th April, we rely on the figure reported by the MOH official twitter account to calculate our cumulative totals. From the 5th May, we rely on the figures reported by the MOH official twitter account and check figures against press releases where they have been made available by the MOH.  

We are aware of Uganda's [MOH information portal](https://covid19.gou.go.ug/), however, it only lists the 'cumulative # tested' without specifying more precise units of measurement. Our cumulative totals for the number of samples tested from 19/04 matches the 'cumulative # tested' total in the Uganda information portal for 20/04. This suggests the 'cumulative # tested' refers to the samples tested up until the previous day. However, the cumulative totals calculated via the daily press releases and the MOH information portal diverge from the 29th April."

As of 2 June 2020, the source notes that ""reporting on the number of people tested has been temporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting across all pillars.

In our time series for ""tests performed"", we aggregate the data for the United Kingdom based only on two ""pillars"":

- Pillar 1: swab testing in Public Health England (PHE) labs and NHS hospitals for those with a clinical need, and health and care workers;
- Pillar 2: swab testing for the wider population, as set out in government guidance. For this pillar we exclude ""Delivery (tests sent out)"", since we aim to include completed tests in the dataset, not only distributed tests. The source does not make it clear how many of these delivered tests are being returned and processed.

These combined criteria mean that our time series starts on 26 April 2020. We do not include other pillars, i.e.

- Pillar 3: this pillar consists (fully) of serology tests, which we aim not to include;
- Pillar 4: this pillar consists (partly) of serology tests, which we aim not to include, and positive tests results from this pillar seem not to be included in the government's total for positive cases.

The source notes that ""data on UK tests is updated daily. The figures for test results are compiled from different sources. Daily totals reflect actual counts reported for the previous day. Each day there may be corrections to previous reported figures. This means that previously published daily counts will not necessarily sum to the latest cumulative figure. It also means that today’s cumulative count may not match the previous day’s cumulative count plus today’s daily count."""
USA,United States - tests performed (CDC),2020-06-22,https://web.archive.org/web/20200623131607/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html,United States CDC,,27,27317035,82.528,,,549865,1.661,United States CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html,"The number of tests performed. The figures are the sum across states, some of which appear to include antibody tests in addition to PCR tests.","On 13 May 2020, the United States CDC's testing data was modified to include tests performed by commercial, hospital, public health, and CDC laboratories. This new data is available on the [Testing Data in the US](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html) page and [CDC COVID Data Tracker](https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/index.html).

Initially, this data was explicitly described by the CDC as only including viral tests and excluding antibody tests. As recently as [18 May](https://web.archive.org/web/20200518050707/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html) the site stated that 'These data only represent viral tests. Antibody tests are not currently captured in these data.'

However, as of 26 May, there have been a number of media reports noting that the testing figures released by some states – which are aggregated by the CDC – include antibody tests in addition to PCR tests, as discussed in [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/cdc-and-states-are-misreporting-covid-19-test-data-pennsylvania-georgia-texas/611935/) in The Atlantic. 

Within this time, the CDC have also changed the way it described the data to be ambiguous as to whether anitbody tests may be included in their figures (see [26 May update](http://web.archive.org/web/20200526082029/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html)). Our dataset aims to report only PCR tests. But because any antibody tests in the CDC data are not disaggregated, we are unable to exclude them.

No time series is published for this new version of the data. We therefore started collecting on 13 May 2020 the cumulative total of viral tests reported, which is updated daily.

As of [26 May](http://web.archive.org/web/20200526082029/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html), the notes to the data provided by the CDC are limited. They state:

- These data are compiled from a number of sources. Not all tests are reported to CDC.
- The number of positive tests in a state is not equal to the number of cases, as one person may be tested more than once.

The CDC previously published a time series that only covered public health labs and did not include private lab tests, which were occurring in significant numbers. Daily figures were provided since 18 January. This data is still visible on [this page of the CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/previous-testing-in-us.html)."

The Project aim to report on the number of people tested, including private labs, but not all states report their figures in this way. The figures for some states appear to include antibody tests in addition to PCR tests.","This is a collaborative project launched in order to fill some of the important gaps in the testing figures being collated by the CDC.

Testing data is gathered from individual states, as reported in state health department websites, data dashboards and press releases from officials.

As of 26 May, there have been a number of media reports noting that the testing figures released by some states include antibody tests in addition to PCR tests – as discussed in [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/cdc-and-states-are-misreporting-covid-19-test-data-pennsylvania-georgia-texas/611935/) in The Atlantic. Our dataset aims to report only PCR tests. But because some states do not disaggregate these types of tests we are not currently able to exclude the antibody tests.

Other differences across states include: some report the number of tests performed, others the number of people tested; some include private labs, others not; some report negative test results, others only positive test results; some include pending tests, others do not (below we show figures that exclude explicitly pending results).

Moreover, many states do not explicitly provide details about these important factors needed to interpret the data they provide. 

There are issues in comparing the figures over time. The totals given for early on in the outbreak do not include all states. One significant uncertainty is the extent to which the rapid rise in tests seen from the mid-March in part reflects states beginning to report private lab tests.

Overall the figures should be seen as providing a general indication of testing output, rather than a specific count of a given indicator. Given the very incomplete coverage and reporting delays of the CDC data, it provides a very important additional perspective.

The Project documents their work in lots of detail. See the link provided above for full details."

However, based on the context, it is unclear whether this refers to the total number of tests conducted, or number of people who have been tested.","The Vietnamese Ministry of Health update its disease situation statistics page daily with the latest data on confirmed cases, deaths and samples tested. 

It refers to its testing data as 'samples tested', and reports confirmed cases and negative samples separately; 'sample tested' generally matches the sum of confirmed cases and negative samples (though there are occasionally some small discrepancies – we report the sum of positive and negative in this case). This would suggest that 'samples tested' is equivalent to the number of people tested. However, it's unclear whether 'negative samples' includes some instances of resampling for the same person. We therefore cannot say with certainty that these are equivalent.

Using web archives we can reconstruct a daily time-series of total samples by looking at previous versions of the updated website. These daily updates extend back to 2nd March. We cannot say with certainty when testing began, only that as of 2nd March 1753 samples had been tested."

The reported figures include positive, negative, and pending test results. It is not clear how many people have been tested, since the reported figures refer only to the number of tests conducted rather than the number of people tested.

The press release for May 6th 2020 reported that 7,808 PCR and 8,244 ""rapid screening"" tests had been conducted to date. We exclude rapid screening tests from the daily time series that we construct, since we assume that these are antibody tests.

Prior to May 6th 2020, the press releases either: (a) reported a combined cumulative total of PCR and rapid screening tests without providing a breakdown between the two types of tests; or (b) did not clearly specify whether the reported cumulative total was in reference to PCR tests, antibody tests, or both. For this reason, the daily time series we construct begins on May 6th 2020, at which point the press releases began to clearly indicate that the reported cumulative totals only include PCR tests."
